This is an example file for the class, BaseGeometry, and its methods


    >>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
    >>> bg = BaseGeometry()

Calling the method with one string and one int:
    >>> bg.integer_validator("my_int", 12)

With two strings:
    >>> bg.integer_validator("name", "John")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: name must be an integer

passing a negative int:
    >>> bg.integer_validator("distance", -4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: distance must be greater than 0

Check if BaseGeometry is a subclass of object:
    >>> issubclass(BaseGeometry, object)
    True

Check if bg is an instance of BaseGeometry:
    >>> type(bg) is BaseGeometry
    True
